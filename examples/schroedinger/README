Introduction
============

This directory contains a simple example for the integration of the newtons
equation for a large number of interacting particles.

The directory ./src contains the code of the computation and some glue
components like the file particle.adb which contains the main procedure of the
application. The drectory common contains code which is used but not related
to the computation.


What happens in this package can be written as:

    X1(1..N) := Integration( X0 )

    ater all done:
    X0 := X1;

a partition is a in this case X1(P) P in 1..N since all components of the 
state vector X1 can be caculated indepdent of the others.

The Integration is found in the package Compute (compute.adb, compute.ads). It
is a simple runge kutta integration with fixed step width.

This directory contains two test configuration; noncentral.cfg and
central.cfg. Noncentral.cfg represents a non central collisions of two masses
of sifferent masses. Central.cfg specifies the configuration for a central
collision of equal masses. THe later case is being used to elaborate the
accuracy of the simulation using the conservation law for momentum.
